## The Shopping App

### Problem:  Wandering around a grocery store searching for items can be quite time consuming.

### Solution: This application allows users to share their shopping list with other users.  They can then split up and grab items on the list thus reducing the shopping time. 


#### Front End technologies:  React, Redux, Socket.io, Axios
#### Back End technologies: Node, Express, MongoDB, Socket.io-client
#### Bootstrap for layout and design

>> Prior to building this app, I had zero experience with Redux or MongoDB.  I thought it would be a great opportunity to learn working them. I chose Redux because it is a great way to handle the app's state.

>> I used soket.io and socket.io-client to make the app real time, so when users update their shopping list, the other users see it immediately.

>> I have used Node, Express and React to build a couple apps prior to this one but it was great to get more experience with them.
