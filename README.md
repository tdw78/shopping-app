## The Shopping App

### Problem Addressed:  Wandering around a grocery store searching for items can be quite time consuming.

### Solution: This application allows users to share their shopping list with other users.  They can then split up and grab items on the list thus reducing the shopping time. 

#### To build this app, I used the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React and Node 
#### Front End technologies:  React, Redux, Socket.io-client, Axios
#### Back End technologies: Node, Express, MongoDB, Socket.io
#### Bootstrap for layout and design


>> Prior to building this app, I had zero experience with Redux or MongoDB.  I thought this would be a great opportunity to gain experience working with both of them. I chose Redux because it allows components to access the app's state directly opposed to passing the state down the hierarchy through props.  It seemed to require more code to set up initially, but made it easier to pass state, find and fix bugs.

>> I used soket.io and socket.io-client to make the app real time, so when users update their shopping list, the other users see it immediately.

>> I have used Node, Express and React to build a couple apps prior to this one but it was great to get more experience with them.  Express is great to work with because it comes with NPM and all of it's packages.

>> If I had more time to work on this project, I would have definitely spent more time working on the design and layout with Bootstrap.  Also, I would fix a couple of small bugs.  For example, when a user enter incomplete sign up or sign in information, they get an error message but the form does not reset.  The user has to the refresh the page to re-renter their information.
